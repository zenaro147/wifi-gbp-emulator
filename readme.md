# WiFi GBP Emulator
A GameBoy printer emulator which provides the received data over a WiFi connection  
This code has been originally created for a "LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R2 & mini" [ESP8266 based board](https://github.com/esp8266/arduino) and now adapted for a "DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1" [ESP32 based board](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32)

If you have a ESP8266, I recommend to check the original project from [HerrZatacke](https://github.com/HerrZatacke/wifi-gbp-emulator)

The required (recommended) [gameboy printer web interface can be found on github as well](https://github.com/HerrZatacke/gb-printer-web/)  

## Setup
For uploading the Filesystem to the ESP you require the [Arduino ESP32 filesystem uploader](https://github.com/lorol/arduino-esp32fs-plugin). Follow the installation instructions on the repository.
Before compiling the project you need to create a `config.h` inside the project folder  
([`config.h.sample.txt`](/wifi-gbp-emulator/config.h.sample.txt) should be used as a reference)    
I recommended to adjust the parameters there to match with your board 

## Bootmode
The default will alternate the bootmode automatically between printer and server on each boot, so you can use the reset-button to switch modes  

## Configuration
If the device is not configured the default settings (AP only) will be used

### Default config
If not present the ESP will set up an accesspoint with ssid/password `gameboyprinter`  
It will output it's IP adress over the serial monitor and on an optionally connected display  
(usually the device should be accessible via `http://192.168.4.1`)  
It will also be discoverable via Bonjour/mDNS via `http://gameboyprinter.local`  

### Manual Setup via `conf.json`
Wifi setup can be done via a file `conf.json` in the `/data/` folder  
The basic format are as follows:
```` json
{
  "mdns": "gameboyprinter",
  "ap": {
    "ssid":"gameboyprinter",
    "psk":"gameboyprinter"
  },
  "networks": [
    {
      "ssid":"Your SSID",
      "psk":"Your wifi password"
    }
  ]
}
````

All config options are optional

#### `"mdns"`
Change the name by which the printer will be accessible via Bonjour/mDNS

#### `"ap"`
AccessPoint config  
Enter ssid/psk to open an accesspoint different to the default one.

#### `"networks"`
Array of objects with keys ssid/psk  
The first reachable network in that list will be used to conect to  
âš  Do not use more than 10 elements. Otherwise you might see an "Out of Memory" error in the serial monitor  

### Manual Setup via web interface
The following will describe the "raw" interface for updating ther configuration. You will only need this if you decide not to use the existing web-interface

#### Reading
calls to `/wificonfig/get` delivers the actual config (passwords are omitted)

#### Writing
calls to `/wificonfig/set` will update the sent properties  
make sure to send the data as a JSON string in the POST-Body

##### Updating existing networks
* Networks are based on the `ssid`-property
* Existing networks do not have to be sent if they should remain unchanged.
* If the update for a network contains `"delete": true`, the networek will be deleted
* If the update for a network contains a `psk` it will be updated otherwise left untouched

## Automatic update of the webserver content
* You can run [`update_w.ps1`](./update_w.ps1) (windows-powershell) or [`update_w.sh`](./update_w.sh) (bash) to download the latest release of the [gb-printer-web](https://github.com/HerrZatacke/gb-printer-web/releases/) and automatically unzip it to the correct folder  
* After doing so upload the content of that folder to the ESP via the [Arduino ESP32 filesystem uploader](https://github.com/lorol/arduino-esp32fs-plugin) in the Arduino IDE or copy to your SD Card.

## Hardware Setup
Gameboy Original/Color Link Cable Pinout
```
 __________
|  6  4  2 |
 \_5__3__1_/ (at cable)

| Link Cable |  ESP32  |
|------------|---------|
| Pin 1      | Any pin | 
| Pin 2      | G19     |
| Pin 3      | G23     |
| Pin 5      | G18     |
| Pin 6      | G       |

```
Additionally an [OLED Display](https://github.com/HerrZatacke/wifi-gbp-emulator/#oled-display) can be added via G22 -> Display SCL / G21 -> Display SDA. If you have some trouble with these pins, you can use any other GPIO pin as SCL/SDA

## Micro SD Card Setup
You can add a [Micro SD Card like this](https://www.amazon.com/Adapter-Reader-interface-driver-Arduino/dp/B01MSNX0TW/) to save the dumps and the web server content.
To use it, you need to uncomment `#define FSTYPE_SDCARD` and connect the pins following this schema
```
| SD ADAPTER |  ESP32  |
|------------|---------|
| CS         | G15     | 
| SCK        | G14     |
| MISO       | G27     | <-- DON'T USE THE G12... YOU CAN USE ANY OTHER PIN AVAILABLE
| MOSI       | G13     |
| GND        | G       |
| VCC        | V5      |

```
Instead use the [Arduino ESP32 filesystem uploader](https://github.com/lorol/arduino-esp32fs-plugin), just format your SD Card to `FAT32` and copy de content of `DATA` folder to the root of your SD card

## OLED Display
You can add a [tiny oled display like this](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07BDFXFRK) or [(probably) this](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/32672229793.html)   
To use it, you need to uncomment `#define USE_OLED` and the following lines   
The display will show the current wifi-config while in server mode, as well as the number of printed images  when in printer mode

## Known Bugs
* WifiMulti doesn't work properly. Only Access Point works or using a single Wifi Network;
* Only 5 games don't have support yet. You can check the compatibility list here: [Game Boy Printer Emulator - Games Support](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RQeTHemyEQnWHbKEhUy16cPxR6vA3YfeBbyx2tIXWaU/edit#gid=0)
